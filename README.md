# Machine Learning models in sklearn
This is a personal archive of ML notes. I hope to facilitate and reinforce my learning process through rigourous documentation and having some sense of ownership of my learning.

1. Linear Regression (multivariable)
2. Polynomial Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression (binary classification)
4. K-nearest Neighbor
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Random Forest
